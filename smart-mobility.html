            The development of an increasingly complex city and the increasing population in it, especially in urban areas causing congestion of the city. On the other hand, the ever-evolving technology presents a potential that can dampen this situation. The potential of smart mobility is assumed to be able to transform urban transportation.
          </p>
          <p>
            In 2008, humans scored a new history because in that year, the number of people living in urban areas exceeded the number of people dwelling in rural areas. By 20251, it is predicted that two-thirds of the world's population will live in large urban centers. The rise in urban density not only increases the volume of vehicles, but also the volume of congestion. <br>
            In addition to impacting the quality of life of road users, the lack of efficiency in urban transportation also causes businesses to lose billions of dollars due to high economic costs and trigger negative environmental consequences. <br>
            Not all solutions offered can cope with city congestion. Building more roads, for example, is not always effective because of the narrowness of physical space, limited budget, and environmental affairs.
          </p>
          <p>
            Well, technology has begun to play a key role in solving urban transportation challenges. One of them is Intel who believes that the innovative use of the latest technology can accelerate the development of "smart mobility" that will lead to digitization and efficient system to move the human and goods.internet of things BlackBerry version
          </p>
          <p>
            According to Harry K. Nugraha, Harry K. Nugraha, Country Manager, Intel Indonesia, new modes of transportation, ranging from vehicle-sharing, ride-sharing, to driverless cars, are emerging due to technologies such as internet connectivity and smartphones. These technologies have opened the door to "Internet of Things", a world where information and services are tailored to the needs of every person.
          </p>
          <p>
            Now, urban transport can be a system that focuses on urban residents. This system extends mobility options, allowing citizens to move from one city point to another by walking or using public, private, or loan transportation. The system also incorporates supporting goods and services, such as fuel and parking lots. <br>
            However, urban transport, from the streets to trains and buses, is still governed by governmental institutions and non-connected private organizations. This is what can cause discomfort for the citizens of big cities. Since the beginning of 2000, governments have begun to realize the importance of cities to focus on how to improve each individual's comfort, improve collaboration, and raise efficiency.

            <b>Smart Mobility Framework</b>
          </p>
          <p>
            Intel has a vision of a smart mobility framework, which includes transformations in five tech-driven areas:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Mobility services: Fuel services and smarter parking</li>
            <li>Public transit: The next generation of tickets and information systems</li>
            <li>Traffic settings: Signaling and intersection settings, traffic control center</li>
            <li>Identification and payment marks: Toll payments and vehicle identification digitally
            <li>Secure infrastructure: Incident</li> detection, bridge monitoring, video surveillance</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            The infrastructure is underpinned by a technology system that captures, stores and analyzes critical data to gain an understanding that can be used when making decisions. This data can be shared across systems to enable responsive and predictive responses without forgetting the high level of security and privacy.
          </p>
          <p>
            "We have a vision that these solutions can work together to increase their value. Solutions made from technology and tools based on open standards will support integration and expansion. These solutions should be designed together, ideally through public and private partnerships, so that the solutions offered can have far-reaching impacts, "said Kenny Sng, Solution Architect, Industry Solution Group, Intel Asia Pacific Japan.
          </p>
          <p>
            He added that this vision is only the beginning. We are on the threshold of the "fourth industrial revolution" in which the physical and digital worlds will be completely united. The city that today thinks about digital transportation will be a vibrant urban center in the future.
          </p>
          <p>
            Intel has collaborated with automakers, suppliers, academic communities and cities around the world to realize intelligent mobility, which includes autonomous driving, smart fleet management and smart transport systems (intelligent transportation systems). Smart mobility is driven by In technology
