          Smart Government is one of the basic elements that must be met to realize Smart City. In general, Smart Government is a term that refers to the effective implementation of ICT in public services in the field of governance. Meanwhile, Smart City in addition to including government administration also handles health services, transportation, education, and so forth.
        </p>
        <p>
          The question of the concept of merging out the problems of administrative services in a society with technology has been a long-standing conversation around the world for a long time. It is also then that encourages the emergence of the term e-government in the past.
        </p>
        <p>
          At that time, e-government focused on initiatives so that technology could be used to improve the quality and effectiveness of public services. Then some time afterwards, e-government implementation began to be seen with the real-time and faster service in government agencies. Unfortunately, the weakness of the e-government concept is that its services are exclusive, meaning they are still separate for each service and agency.
        </p>
        <p>
          With the foundation of e-government that already exist, then later emerged an update version called Smart Government. In Smart Government, public service is done centrally, its service system is integrated. The impact is that the system within Smart Government can sustain and ensure the ease of service access effectively.
        </p>
        <p>
          In some of its practices in Indonesia to date, Smart Government has different system names and systems for each region. But the concept is actually the same, namely the ease of public services and licensing. For example the Government of Surabaya and Sleman, through a machine called e-Kiosk. The e-Kiosk system is a real-time public service kiosk and one door. Through e-Kiosk people can submit all forms of licensing and public service applications without having to move from one government agency to another. Until April 2015, the Mayor of Surabaya, Tri Rismaharini, said that there are already 203 e-Kiosks throughout Surabaya.
        </p>
        <p>

          While in Jakarta and Bandung, in addition to the ease of public services and licensing, another concept of its Smart Government is transparency. That is closer the community with government employees. Complaints to the government and the provision of reputation to regional devices can be done directly through online applications.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some of these cities also integrate Smart Government directly with the big apps Smart City. The seriousness of Bandung City Government in realizing this integration is evidenced by the construction of Command Center, the control center for all Smart City components including Smart Government.
        </p>
        <p>
          Similar steps are also immediately realized by the Provincial Government of DKI Jakarta.Pasca realization of the Smart Government, means that local governments no longer just compete with other regions nationally in terms of quality of public services, but also globally. Smart Government is directed to build a friendly Smart City for everyone.
        </p>
        <p>
          That is, Smart Government must be able to maintain and improve the ease of access all-in-one. No more confusion, long queues at various government agencies, and filling out the sheets of paper.
